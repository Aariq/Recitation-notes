## Chi-square with expected probabilities

Phenotypes: | Yellow & Round | Green & Round | Yellow & Wrinkled | Green & Wrinkled
------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------
Offspring:  | 93             | 31            | 28                | 8

**Do offspring ratios support a diyhybrid cross model?**

Observed numbers:

```{r}
Obs <- c(yellowround = 93, greenround = 31, yelowwrinkled = 28,  greenwrinkled = 8)
```

Expected probabilities:

```{r}
Exp.p <- c(9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16)
```

## Chi-square with expected probabilities

Do the test with `chisq.test()`

- Supply observed numbers and expected probabilities

```{r}
chisq.test(Obs, p = Exp.p)
```
>- **Interpretation?**

## Chi-squared with expected values

Use `rescale.p = TRUE` to use expected *values* instead of expected probabilities

```{r}
Exp <- c(yellowround = 90, yelowwrinkled = 30, greenround = 30, greenwrinkled = 10)
sum(Obs) == sum(Exp) #the expected numbers of each type.

chisq.test(Obs, p = Exp, rescale.p = TRUE)
```

## Chi-squared with expected ratios

You could also supply the 9:3:3:1 expected *ratio*

```{r}
props <- c(9, 3, 3, 1)
chisq.test(Obs, p = props, rescale.p = TRUE)
```


## G test

- The package we installed for Dunnett's Test also has a G-test function!

- Unlike `chisq.test()`, you *must* supply expected **probabilities**.

```{r}
#library(DescTools)
GTest(Obs, p = Exp.p) #'p' must be probabilities
```
>- **Interpretation?**

## Exact binomial test

- If there are only two categories, you can use a binomial test.  
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Punnett_square_mendel_flowers.svg/200px-Punnett_square_mendel_flowers.svg.png")
```

- You cross two heterozygous corn plants and get 243 dwarf offspring and 682 giant offspring.  
- Is plant size a Mendelian trait?
1. Define "success" (totally arbitrary)
2. Probability of "success" = 3/4 if you chose "giant", 1/4 if you chose "dwarf"


## Exact binomial test in R
```
binom.test(c(<<#successes>>, <<#failures>>), p = <<probability of success>>)
```
If success is "giant":
```{r binomial test}
binom.test(c(682, 243), p = 3/4)
```

## Interpretation
```{r echo=FALSE}
binom.test(c(682, 243), p = 3/4)
```
- Accept or reject null?
- Is it Mendelian?


# Contingency

## Contingency analysis

**Context 1:** Assign samples to levels of categorical variable, measure a categorical variable.

**Context 2:** Random sample individuals and measure *two* categorical variables.

Both have two categorical variables, but data entry and data visualization might differ.

## Contingency tables
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Table_of_gender_by_major.png")
```

- Inherently untidy!
- It's basically impossible to enter contingency tables *directly*.
- We'll cover two possible formats of data that we can convert to contingency tables in R:

1. Already tabulated data, like you might be likely to get from context 1 experiments
2. Two columns of categorical data, like you might be likely to get from context 2 experiments


## Starting with frequncy data (context 1){.smaller}

Angina treatment data from lecture:

- Every combination of treatment and symptoms and # of people in each group.
- You might record data in this format since you *assigned* the groups and simply counted individuals with or without symptoms.

```{r}
angina <- read.csv("Angina.csv")
angina
#Try using `View(angina)`
```

## Converting frequency data into a contingency table

- `"table"` is a special class in R.
- R knows how to do things like $\chi^2$ tests automatically on `table`s. 
- We need to make our `data.frame` into a `table`. 
- In this case, we do that with `xtabs()`, which takes a formula.

```{r}
class(angina)
```

## Making a `table` with `xtabs()`

- Uses formula interface.
- `Freq` as explained by `Treatment` and `Symptoms`

```{r}
angina.table <- xtabs(Freq ~ Treatment + Symptoms, data = angina)
angina.table

class(angina.table)
```


## Starting with tidy data (context 2)

- Example 9.4 from the text: Are fish infected by a trematode worm eaten or not?
- Two columns of factors: infection status and predation (eaten or not)
- What makes this tidier than the previous example?

```{r rows.print=5}
worm <- read.csv("WormGetsBird.csv")
worm
```

## Tabulating data

We *could* get this into the same format as the previous example (a frequency table) using `count()` and then use `xtabs()` on it...

```{r}
worm %>% count(infection, bird_predation)
```
...But there is another way

## Tabulating data

- `table()` is *another* function for making contingency tables
- Unlike `xtabs()` it takes two vectors of categorical data as input.

```{r}
worm.table <- table(worm$infection, worm$bird_predation)
worm.table
class(worm.table)
```

## Two ways to make tables!

- `xtabs()`: Use when you have a column of frequencies and two columns of factors.  Uses the formula interface.
```
mytable <- xtabs(freq ~ factor1 + factor2, data = mydata)
```
- `table()`: Use when you have two columns of categorical data and each row is an observation. Needs vectors so you have to use the `$` operator.
```
mytable <- table(myotherdata$factorA, myotherdata$factorB)
```

## Adding margins to a contingency table


```{r}
angina.table %>% addmargins()
worm.table %>% addmargins()
```

## Contingency tests

Once you have a contingency table of the class `table`, it's easy to do statistical tests

```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/9lMoyThpKynde/giphy.gif")
```


## Fisher's Exact test for 2x2 tables

```{r}
fisher.test(angina.table)
```
- Accept or reject null?
- Did the drug work?

## $\chi^2$ test

```{r}
chisq.test(worm.table)
```
- Accept or reject null?
- Is fish predation contingent on infection status?

## $\chi^2$ test

```{r}
chisq.test(angina.table)
```

## G-test
- `GTest()` function from the `DescTools` package

```{r}
GTest(worm.table)
```

# Plotting Contingency Data

## Mosaic plots

- `ggmosaic` adds `geom_mosaic()` for plotting contingency data
- Works on tidy data, **not** `table`s

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggmosaic)
ggplot(worm) + 
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(bird_predation, infection), fill = bird_predation)) +
  labs(x = "Infection Status", y = "Bird Predation")
```

## Using geom_mosaic(){.smaller}

- `geom_mosaic()` is a little weird, because mosaic plots are a little weird
- `aes()` *MUST* go inside of `geom_mosaic()`, *NOT* inside of `ggplot()`.
- Rather than supplying an x and a y aesthetic, you supply only x as a `product()`.  I know, weird.

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4}
library(ggmosaic)
ggplot(worm) + 
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(bird_predation, infection)))
```

## Prettying up `geom_mosaic()`

- Add color with the `fill` aesthetic
- Add axis labels

```{r fig.height=3.2, fig.width=5}
ggplot(worm) + 
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(bird_predation, infection), fill = bird_predation)) +
  labs(x = "Infection status", y = "Bird predation")
```

## Mosaic plot for angina data{.smaller}

- `angina` data isn't tidy!
- Convert frequency table to tidy data with `uncount()` from `tidyr`

```{r rows.print=5}
angina
angina.tidy <- angina %>% tidyr::uncount(weights = Freq)
angina.tidy
```

## Mosaic plot for angina data

Now we can plot the tidy data with `geom_mosaic()`

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
ggplot(angina.tidy) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Symptoms, Treatment), fill = Symptoms)) +
  labs(x = "Treatment", y = "Symptoms")
```

## Try on your own!
`mtcars` is a dataset in `ggplot2` from *Motor Trends* magazine.  `gear` is the number of gears a car has and `am` is whether a car has manual (1) or automatic (0) transmission.

- Is # of gears contingent on transmission type?
- Make a mosaic plot
- Do a statistical test

```{r rows.print=4}
mtcars
```

df2 <-
  df %>% 
  gather(-x, key = group, value = y)

ggplot(df2 %>% filter(x > 0, y > 0), aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +

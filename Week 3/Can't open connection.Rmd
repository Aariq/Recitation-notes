If you have a typo in the file name, or the file isn't in the same folder as the .Rmd file, you'll get a "cannot open the connection" error.

```{r}
ctrees <- read.csv("Camridge Trees.csv")
```

Whoops! There was a typo in the file name!  Try again:

```{r}
ctrees <- read.csv("Cambridge Trees.csv")
```
Whoops!  The file is actually in a folder called "data", not in the same folder as this .Rmd file.

```{r}
ctrees <- read.csv("data/Cambridge Trees.csv")
```

```{r}
head(ctrees)
```

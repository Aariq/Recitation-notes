This will fail if you don't load `dplyr` **first**.  You'll get a "can't find function" error because `%>%` is part of the `dplyr` package, and it isn't loaded.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
chickwts %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(weight))
```

```{r}
chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(weight))
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```

## Without kable()

```{r}
chickwts %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(weight), var = var(weight), n = n())
```

## With kable()

```{r}
chickwts %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(weight), var = var(weight), n = n()) %>% 
  kable()
```


## Making fancy ANOVA tables

You can use `kable()` directly on the output of some statistics funcitons, including `anova()`

```{r}
m <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
anova(m)
```

```{r}
anova(m) %>% kable()
```

**But be careful!** It rounds your numbers for you by default!  p = 0 is impossible, so you'll have to edit the table in the Word output.

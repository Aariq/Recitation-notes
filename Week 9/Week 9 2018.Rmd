- Kruskal-Wallis test


# ANOVA example

## `chickwts`

...Sorry if you're sick of this dataset!

```{r}
str(chickwts)
```

Only two columns: one for weight, one describing the type of feed

Variable name = `feed`, 6 *levels* to that variable

## Faceted histogram

Let's start by making a faceted histogram to check normality

Later I will show you a **better** way to check for normality.

```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(bins = 8) + facet_wrap("feed")
```

## Doing an ANOVA in R

> 1. Make the ANOVA model with `aov()`. This sets up the model, calculates sums of squares, but doesn't do the statistical test
> 2. Get residuals with `fortify()` from the `ggplot2` package and check normality of **residuals**.
> 3. If your model passes the check (#2), run `anova()` on your model (this calculates the statistics)


# ANOVA step 1: set up the model

## Make an ANOVA model with `aov()`

This calculates sums of squares, but doesn't calculate F or p-value yet

```{r}
chick.aov <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
chick.aov #don't need to do this, just for demo purposes!
```

## The `aov` model object

If you type `chick.aov$`, you'll get a dropdown menu that shows what it contains (you can also use `str(chick.aov)`)

We're going to use the residuals!

```{r}
str(chick.aov)
```

## Doing an ANOVA in R

1. Make the ANOVA model with `aov()`
2. **Check assumptions on residuals from this model**
3. If your model passes the check (#2), run `anova()` on your model

# ANOVA step 2a: extract the residuals

## What are residuals?

## What are residuals?

Residuals are individual values minus group means

$$
Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{i}
$$

## What are residuals?

We *could* calculate residuals manually with `mutate()`

```{r rows.print=6}
chickwts %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  mutate(group_mean = mean(weight), 
         residuals = weight - group_mean)
```

## Get residuals with fortify() {.smaller}

You can get residuals into a data frame format with `fortify()`

`fortify(<<some model>>)` returns a data frame with your original data and some extra columns extracted from the model:

- `.fitted` = "fitted" values (*i.e.* group means)
- `.resid` = residual values
- Don't worry about the rest!

```{r rows.print=9}
fortify(chick.aov)
```

# ANOVA step 2b: check normality of residuals

## Histogram of residuals

No need to separate by `feed`!

```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(fortify(chick.aov), aes(x = .resid)) + geom_histogram(bins = 8)
```

## Normal probability plot of residuals

No need to separate by `feed`!

```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(fortify(chick.aov), aes(sample = .resid)) + 
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line() + coord_flip()
```

## Shapiro test on residuals

No need to separate by `feed`!

`shapiro.test()` still needs a *vector* rather than a data frame

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shapiro.test(chick.aov$residuals)
#OR
shapiro.test(fortify(chick.aov)$.resid)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
shapiro.test(chick.aov$residuals)
```

## Doing an ANOVA in R

1. Make the ANOVA model with `aov()`
2. Check assumptions on **residuals** from this model
3. **If your model passes the check (#2), run `anova()` on your model**

# ANOVA step 3: run the test!

## Use `anova()` to run the test.

*Now* we get to see our p-value!

```{r eval=FALSE}
anova(chick.aov)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
anova(chick.aov) %>% print()
```

## What if data aren't normal?

- `InsectSprays` is data on the effectiveness of insecticides
    + Researchers applied insecticides A through F 
    + Then they counted insects in the fields
- Unlikely to be normal since it is **count** data

```{r rows.print=5}
InsectSprays
```


## Summarize

One thing we can do is calculate some summary statistics to get an idea if it meets assumptions of ANOVA

```{r}
insectsummary <- InsectSprays %>% 
  group_by(spray) %>% summarize(n = n(), var = var(count))
insectsummary
```

Sample size is not exactly *huge*, and variances differ by > 10Ã—

# Coding Hack: `kable()`

## Making pretty tables

- Data frames look pretty and interactive in your .Rmd file, but print out like boring R output in Word
- Format them as actual tables with `kable()` from `knitr`!
- You already have `knitr` installed, but you have to load it or specify with `::`
```{r eval=FALSE}
insectsummary %>% knitr::kable() %>% print()
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
insectsummary %>% knitr::kable() %>% print()
```


## Check for homogeneity of variances

Let's formally test our suspicions about variance
```{r eval=FALSE}
leveneTest(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
leveneTest(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays) %>% print()
```


## Set up the model

Let's set up the model with `aov()` and `fortify()` it so we can use **residuals** to check the normality

```{r}
insect.m <- aov(count  ~ spray, data = InsectSprays)
insect.fort <- fortify(insect.m)
head(insect.fort) #don't need to inspect fortified data for homeworks.  Just for demonstration!
```

## Check assumption of normality

We can do this a few ways:

- With a histogram
- With a normal probability plot
- With `shapiro.test()`

## With a histogram

What do you think?

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(insect.fort, aes(x = .resid)) + geom_histogram(bins = 8)
```

## With a normal probability plot

What do you think? (Feel free to refer to your handout)

```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(insect.fort, aes(sample = .resid)) + 
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line() + coord_flip()
```

## With `shapiro.test()`

What do you think?

```{r}
shapiro.test(insect.m$residuals)
```


## Do the data meet our assumptions?

- Histogram: a little leptokurtic
- Normal probability plot: even more leptokurtic
- Shapiro-Wilk test: $p > 0.01$, so not terrible
- Levene's test: doesn't pass, unequal variance
- Sample size: 12 each (not great)

# Transform!

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/7c0bE2bfJrfos/giphy.gif")
```


## Transform!

Count data are often "fixed" by a log transformation

But I should check to see if there are zeroes in the data first!

```{r}
InsectSprays %>% filter(count == 0)
```

There are, so I'll try `log(count + 1)`

## Transform!

```{r}
insects <- InsectSprays %>% mutate(log_count = log(count + 1))
head(insects, 4)
```

NOTE: You *could* overwrite `InsectSprays`, but it's generally a pretty bad idea to overwrite built-in datasets  
 
If you do, it's not permanent, but you will have to run `data(InsectSprays)` to get the original back!
 
## Re-check the transformed data

I'll start with the normal probability plot, skip the histogram, and then double check with `shapiro.test()`

- First, re-fit the `aov()` model and extract residuals again

```{r}
insects.m2 <- aov(log_count ~ spray, data = insects)
insects.fort2 <- fortify(insects.m2)
```

## Re-check with a normal probability

Wow! Looks like we got lucky!

```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(insects.fort2, aes(sample = .resid)) + 
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line() + coord_flip()
```

## Re-check with `shapiro.test()`

Nice!

```{r}
shapiro.test(insects.fort2$.resid)
```

## What about the variances?

Transforming data not only affects normality, but can also mess with homogeneity of variances

Let's check to see if our variance problem is fixed...

```{r eval=FALSE}
leveneTest(log_count ~ spray, data = insects)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
leveneTest(log_count ~ spray, data = insects) %>% print()
```

Excellent!

## ANOVA

Do an ANOVA on the log transformed data that we used to set up `insects.m2`

```{r eval=FALSE}
anova(insects.m2)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
anova(insects.m2) %>% print()
```
The mean log of insect count plus 1 significantly differs among spray types (ANOVA, F = 46.007, df = 5, p < 0.0001).

# Non-parametric ANOVA alternative

## Kruskal-Wallis test

Works like `aov()` and `anova()` combined

Uses the formula interface like `aov()`, but there's no need to save the model and run `anova()`

```{r}
kruskal.test(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays)
```

Insect count differs significantly by spray type (Kruskal-Wallis test, X^2^ = 54.691, df = 5, p < 0.0001)
